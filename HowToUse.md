# Introduction #

Galendar helps to create and share a working calendar with your co-workers. It uses a template to create a sharing calendar for similar projects to save replicating efforts.


# Workflow #

The GUI is organized according to the workflow:
  1. Create a project, and specifying attendees to whom the calendar is to be shared.
  1. Then create individual events, align them to a TBA start date.
  1. Then, log into your Google Calendar; pick a start date; use a current or new calendar to publish your project. After successful pushing, the attendees you specified will have read-write access to the calendar.


# Tabs #

## Project ##

Project tab is where you can manage your templates, including notes and attendees you would like to invite.

## Event ##

Here you can add/delete individual events in a selected project. The "start" is the offset to 00:00 of the TBA start date. This could be after/before the start date.

## Press ##

Follow the flow in the top. First log in with your Google account, and authorize this program to do some work with your Google calendar. Then pick a start date when the project is gonna published. After you see a "Ready to proceed" message below, you can choose a current or new calendar to publish the project. If you are a domain app user, depending on the administrator's settings, you might not be able to share calendars with 3rd party emails.

**REMEMBER**, your selected calendar (existing/new) will be granted read AND write access to those you specified in the first Project tab. Usually you won't like to grant others this level of access on your primary calendar, so be aware. So you are advised to create a new calendar for publishing.
